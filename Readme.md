This is a experimental repository created to practice the basic git skills along with the implementation of some
basic algorithms from scratch using C++/Python

To execute the prorams. simply clone this repo to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/DeekshithAnand/Algorithms.git [Whatever-subdirectory-optional]

Since the repo contains only code, you have to locally build the code using appropriate compiler and execute 
accordingly.

Happy Coding!
